## Data Structures

### List of Programs

<ol>

<li>
<a href="/Data\ Structure/prog1.c">Use Stack operations to do the following:</a>
<ul>
    <li>Assign to avariable name Y the value of the third element from the top of the stack and keep the stack undisturbed.</li>
    <li>Given an arbitrary integer n pop out the top n elements. A message should be displayed if an unusual condition is encountered</li>
    <li>Assign to a variable name Y the value of the third element from the bottom of the stack and keep the stack undisturbed.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
Write a C program that parses Infix arithmetic expressions to Postfix arithmetic expressions using a Stack.
</li>

<li>
Write a C program to simulate the working of Messaging System in which a message is placed in a circular Queue by a Message Sender, a message is removed from the circular queue by a Message Receiver, which can also display the contents of the Queue.
</li>

<li>
Implement a program to multiply two polynomials using single linked list.
</li>

<li>
Write a C program to implement addition of long positive integers using circular single linked list with header node.
</li>

<li>
Design a doubly linked list to represent sparse matrix. Each node in the list can have the row and column index of the matrix element and the value of the element. Print the complete matrix as the output.
</li>

<li>Write a C program to create Binary Tree and provide insertion and deletion operations and to traverse the tree using In-order, Preorder and Post order (recursively)</li>

<li>Given a String representing a parentheses-free infix arithmetic expression, implement a program to place it in a tree in the infix form. Assume that a variable name is a single letter. Traverse the tree to produce an equivalent postfix and prefix expression string.</li>

<li>Write a C program to implement Hashing using Linear probing. Implement insertion, deletion, search and display.</li>

<li>Write a C program to implement priority queue to insert, delete and display the elements.</li>

</ol>

## Operating system

### List of Programs

<ol>

<li>
<strong>Implementation of basic UNIX commands using file APIs-</strong> Write a program to implement commands ls( -l option), cp, rm and mv using UNIX file APIs.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Process control system calls- </strong>Application to demonstrate use of fork, execve, wait, getpid, exit system calls
</li>

<li>
<strong>Thread creation and management using Pthread Library- </strong> Application to demonstrate use of pthread library functions to create and manage threads
</li>

<li>
<strong>Process scheduling and process priority –</strong> Modify the default scheduling algorithm for MINIX or XV6 operating system.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Process/Thread synchronization -</strong> Application to demonstrate process/thread synchronization using semaphores and mutex. Implement Dining philosophers problem, reader-writer and  producer-consumer
</li>

<li>
<strong>Process/Thread synchronization for file access -</strong> Application to demonstrate process/thread synchronization using file locks. 
</li>

<li><strong>Deadlock- </strong> Write a program that implements the Bankers’ algorithm for deadlock avoidance. The program should check for safe sequence and resource request algorithm. </li>

<li><strong>Memory management- </strong>Write a program to simulate Buddy memory allocation algorithm.</li>

<li><strong>Static and Shared libraries- </strong> Write a program to create and use static and shared libraries. Demonstrate the advantage of shared libraries over static libraries in terms of memory usage.</li>
